What part of earth looks like Titan's surface?
===================

The Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn disclosed that Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) has "[extraordinarily Earth-like meteorology and geology](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/titan_images.html)."

[This image](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/titan/huygens_titan_09.jpg) tells the story.  It shows an eerily earth-like system of rivers and lakes that, to my eye, look a lot like New York City's topography, if the Hudson River ran east-west.

It would be fun to find a place on the Earth's surface whose topography actually did match that of the eerie image.  A tabloid would probably buy the story.  :-)

Of course, the contents of the river systems on Titan are liquid methane, but no matter.
